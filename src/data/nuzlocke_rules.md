# Concept

Each encounter rewards random gear when resolved. One choice for each gear slot is rolled from a pool containing every piece of equipment in the game, you then pick ONE of those items to unlock for use in your playthrough. You spawn this item in using mods, you aren't allowed to use any equipment obtained in any other way.

The item pool consists of every item obtainable up to and including the current act regardless of how the item is obtained (quest reward, vendor purchase, loot drop, etc).

Consumables are not part of this restriction.

# Encounters

List of encounters that can be resolved to unlock gear. Resolving an encounter means you must complete the encounter's objective and are awarded the experience. It does not necessitate killing all entities involved in the encounter.
